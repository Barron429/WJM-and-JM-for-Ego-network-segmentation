COMPILATION
----------------------------------------
We used python (3.8.3) and  Gurobi (9.5.1) to implement our algorithms. Our implementation was tested on Windows 10.

PREREQUISITES
----------------------------------------
Libraries:
bitstring==3.1.9
cfractions==2.0.1

DATA INFORMATION
---------------------------------------
All data are included in the folder "data". 
For each dataset (except WOC), we created 5 sequences (ego_list_1.pkl...ego_list_5.pkl).
Each sequence has a ground truth (label_1.txt...label_5.txt)
We also include the raw data (temporal graphs) from which we constructed the ego-network sequences. 

HOW TO RUN SEGMENTATION ALGORITHMS
----------------------------------------

The implemented algorithms are 
DP_EXACT_SC for DP-EXACT_{SC} (D-ESC)	      [Dynamic programming and EXACT-SC] 	
DP_EXACT_SCUB for DP-EXACT-SC_{UB} (D-ESC_UB) [Dynamic programming and EXACT-SC_UB] 
DP_G_SCUB for DP-GSC_{UB} (D-GSC_UB)	      [Dynamic programming and GREEDY-SC_UB] 	
TD_EXACT_SCUB for TD_EXACT-SC{UB} (T-ESC_UB)  [Top-down and EXACT-SC_UB]
TD_G_SCUB for TD-GSC_{UB} (T-GSC_UB)          [Top-down and GREEDY-SC_UB]
TD_HEU for TD-HEU (T-HEU)	              [Top-down and Heuristic without sketces]
TD_HEUS for TD-HEU_{S} (T-HEU_S)      	      [Top-down and Heuristic with sketces]

Any of these algorithms can be executed with: 

python Program_Name.py ./data/Data_name/ego_list_1.pkl ./data/Data_name/Output.txt  ./data/Data_name/label_1.txt k

-- Program_name.py is the name of the algorithm. It can be DP_EXACT_SC, DP_EXACT_SCUB, DP_G_SCUB, TD_EXACT_SCUB, TD_G_SCUB, TD_HEU, or TD_HEUS
-- ./data/Data_name is the path. Data_name can be DBLP, EP, FB, SE, SO, WIKI, or WOC.
-- ego_list_1.pk1 is the first ego-network sequence. Instead of 1, it could be 2,3,4, or 5 for the other ego-network sequences.
-- Output.txt corresponds to the output. The output is displayed on the screen and includes runtime of algorithm, segmeatation results, segmeatation performances (ACC, NMI, F score) and the summary graph of each segment. 
-- label_1.txt is the file containing the ground truth for the first ego-network sequences. Instead of 1, it could be 2,3,4, or 5 for the 
ground truth of the other ego-network sequences.
-- k is the desired number of segments

Example 1:
python DP_G_SCUB.py ./data/dblp/ego_list_1.pkl ./data/dblp/Output.txt  ./data/dblp/label_1.txt 5

Example 2: 
To execute DP_EXACT_SC on the toy data in Fig1 of our paper:
python DP_EXACT_SC.py 

HOW TO RUN SC ALGORITHMS
----------------------------------------
First, please go to SC folder.

The implemented algorithms are 
EXACT_SC for EXACT-SC  
EXACT_SCUB for EXACT-SC_UB
G_SCUB for GREEDY-SC_UB
HEU for Heuristic without sketces
HEUS for Heuristic with sketces
JMA for 2-approximation algorithm 

Any of these algorithms(except EXACT_SC ) can be executed with: 

python Program_Name.py ../data/Data_name/ego_list_1.pkl 

For EXACT_SC, please run:
python EXACT_SC.py
